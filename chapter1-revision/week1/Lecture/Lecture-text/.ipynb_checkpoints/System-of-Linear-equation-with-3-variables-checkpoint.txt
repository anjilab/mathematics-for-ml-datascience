In linear equation with 3 variables, there must be 3 equation to solve get the values of those variables but sometimes these information can be redundant and hence we might not be able to get value of 3 variables.

a + b + c = 10
a + 2b + c = 15
a + b + 2c = 12

In above equation, we can have unique solutions, as information is complete. non-singular. 
For checking singularity, we can make value of 10,15,12 set to 0 and then get the values of a,b & c. We will get (0,0,0), which is unique and complete. hence non-singular.


a + b + c = 10
a + b + 2c = 15
a + b + 3c = 20 

In above equation, we have infinite solutions as when c = 5 a + b = 5 so any values like (1,4,5),(2,3,5),(0,5,5) are one of the solutions. Redundant, singular. 
Another method for singularity is to make, constants in RHS to 0, Again, the information is redundant and hence singular.

a + b + c = 10
a + b + 2c = 15
a + b + 3c = 18

In above equation, we can see that in a + b + 2c = 15 
a + b + c + c = 15
10 + c = 15
c = 5
Similarly, a + b + c + 2c = 18 in equation 3, 
10 + 2c = 18
2c = 8
c = 4

Here, we get c = 5 and c = 4, which is contradiction, hence no solutions.  singular.

a + b + c = 10
2a + 2b + 2c = 20
3a + 3b + 3c = 30 

In above equation, all three line provides same information, i.e a + b + c = 10, hence infinite many solutions (1,2,7), (0,9,1), (2,3,5) So, redundant, singular.

Likewise, in 2 variables, in 3 variables too we can make the R.H.S to 0, and check about singularity.


- Linear equation with 3 variables will represent planes. Any point passing through the plane will be solution for the plane.

When, a + b + c = 0
a + 2b + c = 0
a + b + 2c = 0, these equation are visualized, each equation will have a plane and when brought in same plane. All these will intersect in a point. Hence, non-singluar. 

But for, a + b + c = 0
a + b + 2c = 0
a + b + 3c = 0, when each equation is drawn, we will get plane and then all 3 when brought to single plain we will find that these will intersect at a line. So not just a point but infinite points in a line. So singular.


a + b + c = 0
2a + 2b + 2c = 0
3a + 3b + 3c = 0, This all will overlap each other in the same plane. Hence infinte number of points in the plane making infinite solution, resulting to singular.

a + b + c = 10
a + b + 2c = 17
a + b + 3c = 18
This when drawn together in the same plane, they will become parallel. Hence no solutions making singular.

When, a = 1, b= 2 , a + b = 3 these can be represented as,a = 1 as 1.a + 0.b + 0.c = 1
b = 2 as 0.a + 1.b + 0.c  = 2
a + b =3 as 1.a + 1.b + 0.c = 3
[ 1 0 0 
0 1 0 
1 1 0 ]
Row 3 we can see that will be expressed in terms of sum of row 1 and row 2. Row 3 doesn't provide any new information hence row 3 is linearly dependent upon row 1 and row 2. So, both matrix and system are singular.

a  + b  + c = 0
2a + 2b + 2c = 0
3a + 3b + 3c = 0 

[1 1 1
2 2 2
3 3 3] 
Here Row 2 = 2 * Row 1 
Row 3 =  3 * Row 1 
So, both plane 2 and plane 3 do not provide any new information. Hence, Linear dependent and singular.

a + b + c = 0
a + b + 2c = 0
a + b + 3c = 0
[1 1 1
1 1 2
1 1 3]
Here, add row 1 and row 2 we will get 2a + 2b + 4c = 0, then dividing by 2 we will get a + b + 2c  = 0. Therefore, average of row 1 and row 3 will give rise to row 2. Hence linearly dependent and singular.


a + b + c = 0
a + 2b + c = 0
a + b + 2c = 0

Here, [1 1 1
1 2 1
1 1 2], Here, no matter what we add subtract or divide, it is not possible to obtain one rows being expressed in terms of other. Hence linear independent and non-singular.
