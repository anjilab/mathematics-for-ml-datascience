- System of sentences
    - The dog is black and the cat is orange ⇒ 4 clear information, 2 animals, 2 colors ⇒ complete sentences and are non-singular
    - The dog is black and the dog is black ⇒ same information ⇒ redundant ⇒ singular
    - The dog is black and the dog is white ⇒ 1 animal 2 color ⇒ contradiction ⇒ singular
- System of equations
    
   
    a + b =10
    a + 2b = 12
    This system of equations  has unique  solutions,  complete  and  non-singular
    
    a+b = 10 
    2a + 2b = 20, => a + b =10 
    This  system  of  equations has  infinite  solutions,  redundant  and  singular 
    
    a+b = 10 
    2a + 2b = 24, 
    This  system  of equations  has no   solutions, contradiction  and  singular 
    
    
- Linear equation
    - Variables with power equal to 1.
    - if 2 variables only, represented as line
    - if 3 variables then represented as plane

- System of equation as line
    - When 2 lines in the x-y plane are brought togther then, system of equation deals with two equation in a same plane.
    - These lines will either intersects at a point(single unique solution for those system of equations), never meet(parallel, no solutions exist), coincide/overlap(infinite solutions).
    - At the end, they will always be in the plane. if it intersect at a point then that is said to be unique solution for those equations. 
    - Complete informations, intersects a point, non-singular
    - redundant, coincides, singular
    - contradiction, parallel, singular

- Singularity & Non-singularity in terms of geometric interpretation:

    - Complete, redundant and contradiction are not widely used, as this are based on the value of equation in right hand side.
    - So make the equating values to 0 and again check the completeness and redundant and contradiction will the output of singularity change ? 
    - No. The singularity concept won't change even if equations kind is changed.

    a + b = 0 
    a + 2b = 0
    This system of equations  has unique  solutions,  complete  and  non-singular
    
    a+b = 0
    2a + 2b = 0, => a + b =0 
    This  system  of  equations has  infinite  solutions,  redundant  and  singular 
    
    a+b = 0 
    2a + 2b = 0, 
    This  system  of equations  has infinite solutions, redundant  and  singular 

So, the constants in the equation is not so important.


- The system of equation can be represented in matrix form. After determining the solution, we can know whether it is singular or not. Their corresponding matrix form of the equation can be called as singular and non-singular matrix. 


- Without finding the  number of solutions of equation, we can also determine whether corresponding system of equation matrix can be singular or non-singular.

- By finding whether rows are dependent or not. If no row can form another row then linearly independent. Similarly if any rows can be expressed in terms of another rows then we called linearly independent.

- Finding matrix whether singular or non-singular by using determinant.
- [[a ,b][c,d]] => Linear dependency if a*k =  c or b*k =  d => c/a = d/b = k => ad = bc => ad - bc = 0 => Which is called determinant of matrix. 
- So, for singular ad -bc = 0 for non singular matrix ad - bc != 0.

- Summary of Week 1, Chapter 1, Linear equation with 2 variables:
- System of equations with 2 variables will plot line. When the equations are given, it means that two lines are in the plane and either they intersect each other at a point, overlaps or become parallel.
- When the lines are intersected, that means, there are sufficient information to make the equation complete, hence unique solution, non-singular. If represented in the matrix, the value after equals can be converted into 0 and check the same, the equation beome complete and solution will be unique following the property of non-singularity. In such equation,checking whether one row can be represented into another row,it will not. Hence linearly independent.
- When the lines provide same information, then redundant, infinite solutions, singular. The rows of one equation is same or multiple of another hence, linearly dependent making further confirm towards singular. Again, calculating determinant will be 0. Hence, singular matrix.
- When the lines provide information that contradicts then these lines together in a plane will not have a solution and are singular. The rows of one equation can be expressed interms of another. Hence linearly independent making further confirm towards singular. Similarly calculating determinant will be also 0 making singular matrix.
- Gist, linearly dependent => rows expressed in terms of other => determinant = 0 => singular matrix.
- Note, rows or columns if expressed in terms of other rows or columns respectively for checking linear dependency.

In the matrix, check the number of 1 in diagonal, if there are 2 1's in main diagonal then rank = 2
if 1, 1's in main diagonal, then rank = 1. 
if no 1's in main diagonal, then rank = 0.

so FOR NONSINGULARITY, MATRIX MUST HAVE ONLY ONES(1) IN THE MAIN DIAGONAL.

In large matrix, make sure rows with 0 are at the bottom if any.


Reduced row echelon form is the form of solution of matrix.

Pivot => any number that is in the row echelon form which follows the property i.e making sure 0's at the bottom and the the non-zero number in each row must be at the right of the above one. Number of pivots  = rank.

[3 4 5 6 7
0 0 2 4 8
0 0 0 -4 0
0 0 0 0 0] 

here 3, 2, -4 is pivot. Rank of this matrix is 3
During reduced row echelon form, first convert into row echelon form, and divide rows containing pivot by the pivot value such that pivot will become 1 & make sure above the pivot value, all the respective cols of pivot must be 0 to get reduced row echelon form. Turn anything above pivot to 0.
