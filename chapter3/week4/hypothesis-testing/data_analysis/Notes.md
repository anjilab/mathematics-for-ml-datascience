## DATA ANALYSIS: 

When you already have data, and want to make decision based upon those data, then such process is called data anaylysis. This is not about making decision under uncertainity. If you had to make decision under uncertainity, then we called it as statistical inference. 

# NOTES
Population: whole number of items like whole population, entire group you want your conclusion about
Sample: selected number of items from population, specific group of people you will work with
Statistic: measure taken from sample, so it describes sample
Parameter: measure concerned a population, so it describes population
Sampling: There are probability and non-probability sampling. Non-probability samples are choosen for specific criteria. Non-probability used in qualitative and exploratory research. often used method but proability sampling such as simple probability sampling and stratified can be used to reduce the risk of sampling bias. Probability sampling used in quantitative research.
Sampling error :  difference between population parameter and sample statistic.




So, for data analayis we need to know about: 
1. WHAT KINDS OF DATA i.e DATA TYPE
2. DISTRIBUTIONS OF DATA
3. STATISTICAL TESTS

# DATA TYPES:
Two type of data
1. Qualitative(Categorical): non-numerical data having descriptive information like tastes, colors that cannot be counted or measured. Analyzed through interpretations and categorization.
2. Quantitative: numerical data whose quantity can be measured/counted. Such as height, weight, temperature.Can be expressed in terms of graphs and analyzed through statistical methods.

# QUANTITATIVE 
Different types:
1. Discrete: Distinct values like 1, 2, 3. Do not have any intermediate values in between. 
2. Continuous: infinitely divisible. Between 1 and 2. can take any value between range or interval. it is divided into two types:
    1. Interval: No true zero point
    2. Ratio: True zero point
