## DATA ANALYSIS: 

When you already have data, and want to make decision based upon those data, then such process is called data anaylysis. This is not about making decision under uncertainity. If you had to make decision under uncertainity, then we called it as statistical inference. 

# OVERVIEW OF ANALYSIS
Take two examples 
1. Causal research question: Can fast food impact health of teenagers ? This investigates about cause and effect relationship. 
2. Correlation research question: Is there any relationship between income of parents and visa acceptance for further study ? This investigates correlation between two variables.

# STEPS TO FOLLOW 
1. <b>Write your hypothesis and plan your research design</b>:  To investigate a relationship between variables within population, we begin with prediction and use statistical method to test that prediction. We will set null and alternative hypothesis. These hypothesis are tested using sample data. These hypothesis are based on prediction related to population  but to test/verify it we use sample data. For "Can fast food impact health of teenagers" , H0: "There is no any impact in health of teenager by consuming fast food once a week", H1: "There is significant impact in health of teenager by consuming fast food once a week." Similary for "Is there any relationship between income of parents and visa acceptance for further study" H0: "There is no any relationship between income and visa acceptance" , H1: "There exists a positive coorelation(when income high, visa accept high) between income and visa acceptance." RESEARCH DESIGN can be done by making sure whether research will use descriptive,correlational and experimental design. Experimental directly influence variable you want to study and Descriptive and correlational studies only measure variables. In  1. Experimental Design:  assess cause-effect-relationship by using statistical test of comparison or regression.
 2. Correlational Design: explores relationship between variables where no any assumption is made.
 3. Descriptive Design: study characteristics of population using statistical tests to draw inference from sample data.
Here, we will also compare the participants at the group or individual or both. It includes, between-subjects , within-subjects, mixed

    1. Within-subject(repeated measure): Here all the participants are introduced to all variables you are trying to measure. For example: if the study is done based on relationship between exercise and memory. In your research exercise has 2 independent variables i.e jogging and yoga. In case of within subject all participants take part in jogging and take memory test as well as same participant take part in yoga and take memory test. We do not divide groups. Same participants take part in both measures. Our test will be which exercise will have siginificant impact on memory.  2*2 within subject design means factorial design where we can look at the effects of 2 or more independent variables. In 2*2 design, two types of therapy and two levels of each treatment (short-term or long-term). Good: when we have limited participants, minimize noise in your study. (Here, the same individual is presented with all the conditions so if his mood is bad in one condition, overall conditions it will be bad but in case oof between subject good mood exposed to only one condition so greater result due to mood in this condition but in another condition they are not exposed so couldn't study their impact. Bad: Carryover effect, i.e when one do yoga and take test then he/she does jogging and take a test. The second test might come good because they also have done yoga already so the effect of first variable can impact in later test. GIST:ALL PARTICIPANTS IN SURVEY RECEIVES EVERY TREATMENT OR VARIABLES WE ARE TRYING TO MEASURE.
    2. Between Subject(between-groups): Here participants are assigned to single treatment only. One group takes part in jogging and another group takes part in yoga. Then test can be done to determine which exercise will have influences on memory.
    3. Mixed (factorial) design: One variable is altered between subjects and another is aletered within subject design.

In case of cause and effect relationship example: You can design within subject design experiment where same group of individual health is measures in 1 week and then the same individual take test after having fast food in a week. One test scores of health before consuming and another after consuming. Independent variable is consumption of fast food. Dependent variable is health test before and after consumption.

In case of correlational, we don't have dependent and independent variable. Rather we  just want to measure  variables without influencing them in any way. 

So now comes topic of measuring variables. There are quantitative and categorical variable which will be described in detail below. In case of cause and effect study: age (ratio), test scores(interval) are quantitative, gender and ethnicity are quantitative (nominal) variables. In case of correlational study:  parental income (ratio) and visa acceptance (binary) quantitative variables. 

2. Collection of data from sample: Sampling can be done by probability and non-probability sampling.  You should have sufficient sample size. Too small cannot be representative and too large expensive than what was necessary. Significance level(the risk you are willing to take to reject null hypothesis when it is true usually 5%) , statistical power(the probability of your study detecting an effect of a certain size if there is one, usually 80% or higher), expected effect size, population std deviation. 

3. Summarize data using descriptive statistics: Using (mean, std deviation,variance, range) , displaying in bar chart/scatter plot.

4. Test hypothesis or make estimates using inferential statistics: Hypothesis testing, parametric testing, point estimate and interval estimate.

5. Interpret your result: Determine statistical significance(p-value < significance level), effect size (though result is significant you need to determine its significance in real life applications, practical significance of your results.  In case of causal-effect relationship Cohen's d is used whereas in correlational study pearson's correlation coefficient is used.

# NOTES
Population: whole number of items like whole population, entire group you want your conclusion about
Sample: selected number of items from population, specific group of people you will work with
Statistic: measure taken from sample, so it describes sample
Parameter: measure concerned a population, so it describes population
Sampling: There are probability and non-probability sampling. Non-probability samples are choosen for specific criteria. Non-probability used in qualitative and exploratory research. often used method but proability sampling such as simple probability sampling and stratified can be used to reduce the risk of sampling bias. Probability sampling used in quantitative research.
Sampling error :  difference between population parameter and sample statistic.


So, for data analayis we need to know about: 
1. WHAT KINDS OF DATA i.e DATA TYPE
2. DISTRIBUTIONS OF DATA
3. STATISTICAL TESTS

# DATA TYPES:
Two type of data
1. Qualitative(Categorical): Groupings. non-numerical data having descriptive information like tastes, colors that cannot be counted or measured. Analyzed through interpretations and categorization. Group
2. Quantitative: Amounts. numerical data whose quantity can be measured/counted. Such as height, weight, temperature.Can be expressed in terms of graphs and analyzed through statistical methods.

# QUANTITATIVE 
Different types:
1. Discrete: Distinct values like 1, 2, 3. Do not have any intermediate values in between.  Integer variables. Number of students in the class.
2. Continuous: Ratio variables. infinitely divisible. Between 1 and 2. can take any value between range or interval. Age, volume, Distance.  it is divided into two types:
    1. Interval: No true zero point
    2. Ratio: True zero point
  
# QUALITATIVE
Though they can be represented as numbers, these numbers are simply group representation rather than the count. 
Categorical and Ordinal.
1. Categorical :  Distinct categories or class or groups with no any specific order. Further divided into Binary variables only two possible outcomes or categories or class. (0 or 1 or combination of 0's and 1's) eg of binary: coin flip, yes or no decision. 
2. Ordinal:  Data with natural order among its categories or groups indicating differences or preferences. (1st,2nd or 3rd). Has specific order. EG: finishing place in race, likert scale, rating scale, Star ratings in product is ordinal data but average star rating is quantitative data.
3. Nominal: Groups with no order or rank between them. Eg: Colors, Vehicle type


# INDEPENDENT AND DEPENDENT VARIABLE
We usually conduct experiment to find out  effect of one variable onto another. 
1. Independent variables: Treatment, Variable you think that might be the cause. Exercise is independent variable in memory test. Due to involving in exercise affects memory. The cause of affecting memory is exercise. so exercise = independent variable. You manipulate this variable to affect the outcome of the experiment. 
2. Dependent variables: Response, Variable you think that might be the effect. Memory is dependent variable in memory test. Doing exercise or not doing exercise impacts memory. You are measuring this variable. It is the outcome of the experiment.

In case of correlational research, there is no independent and dependent variables.

# Level of measurement
How precisely variables are recorded.
1. Nominal: Categorized only (Vehicle type,Colors). [=,!=]. [mode (central tendency)] can only be measured.  
2. Ordinal: Categorize and ordered ( Finishing rank in race, likert type questions, very satisfied to dissatisfied, we can order it but can not tell how close or far apart the orders are.). [= & !=  & < or >],[ mode, median], [range(varibility) and interquartile range]
3. Interval: Categorized, ordered, and evenly spaced (test scores), no true zero point. difference between any two adjacent tempertaures in celsius and Fahrenheit is one or greater than 1 but never 0. for eg: 32 and 31 is 1. [ = & !=  & < or >, + ,- ], [mode, median, mean], [range(varibility) and interquartile range, std deviation, variance.] discrete or continuous
4. Ratio: Categorized, ordered, evenly spaced and true zero. Age, weight. True zero = absence of variable of interest. [= & !=  & < or >, + ,- , *,%,], [mode, median, mean, geometric mean] , [range(varibility) and interquartile range, std deviation, variance., relative std deviation], discrete or continuous.
Depending upon measure of variables you can analyze your data.

 Operations | Nominal | Ordinal | Interval | Ratio
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Collection  | By Close ended Questions(gender male or female), open ended Questions (blanks, like age) | close ended question survey | 
|  Descriptive analysis | Frequency distribution table (count or percentage) | Frequency distribution table (count or percentage)  or bar charts  | grouped frequency distribution table or frequency distribution polygon graph | grouped frequency distribution table or frequency distribution polygon graph |
| central tendency | mode | median and mode | mean, median, mode| mean, median, mode, geometric mean |
| variability | - | range | range , std deviation, varaince | range , std deviation, varaince , relative std. deviation |
|  Statistical Test | chi-square goodness of fit test and chi-square test of independence  | any measurement focused on rankings of measurement they are non-parametric tests | both parametric and non-parametric tests | parametric tests |

## Descriptive Statistics 
Summarize and organize characteristics of a data set. 
1. Distribution: Simple frequency distribution or grouped frequency distribution
2. Central tendency: Center or average of data set. Mean, Median and Mode.
3. Variability: How spread out the response variables are from the center.spread,scatter,dispersion . Range, Std deviation, variance.

NOTE WHILE FINDING STD DEVIATION OF POPULATION DIVIDE BY N BUT WHEN STD DEVIATION OF SAMPLE DIVIDE BY N-1. Inter quartile range Q3-Q1. It helps in determining skewness of distribution. BOX PLOT IS EASIEST TO LOOK AT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN QUARTILES. Negatively skewed median to Q3 less gap. Positively skewed means Q1 and median less gap.


# PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION
Proability = relative frequency over an infinite number of trials.
A variable can take different values. The probability of different possible values of a variable is called probability distribution. In case of frequency distribution we have number of times of different possible values a variable can take place. 
By law of large numbers, as the sample size increases, the relative frequency of outcomes converges to true probability. that is for more data,the observed frequency in frequency distribution becomes increasingly representative of underlying proability distribution. Frequency distribution is converted by finding the probability of specific value by ratio of frequency of that value to the total number of observations.

1. Probability mass function (discrete variables)
2. Probability density function (continuous variables)


Normally, there are two distributions:
1. Parametric: Assumption is made that data follows a certain specific distribution pattern and parameters of that distribution is estimated from that data.  Normal, Weibull, poisson, exponential  
2. Non-parametric: No any assumption regarding data following certain distribution. Defined without assuming underlying parameters. Uniform, bernoulli, empirical

## Normal distribution 
<ul>
    <li> Bell shaped</li>
    <li>No skewness, centers/symmetric around mean stating that data around mean are more frequent in occurrence than the data far from the mean. most of the values clusters around mean.  </li>
    <li>Mean, median and mode are same</li>
    <li>Symmetric about mean</li>
    <li>Distribution described by mean and std deviation</li>
    
</ul>

Most of all kinds of variables in social sciences are normally distributed. Age, Weight, Test scores, these data are normally distributed.
The CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM IS THE BASIS ON HOW NORMAL DISTRIBUTION WORK IN STATISTICS.
To get good idea of population, we'd collect multiple random samples within the population. A sampling distribution of the mean is the distribution of the means of these different samples. The central limit theorem states that by using 
1. law of large number, as the sample size increases, the sample mean will approach the population mean.
2. with multiple large samples, sampling distribution of the mean is normally distributed, even if your original variable is not normally distributed. 


Statistical test assumes
1. The data are normally distributed
2. groups that are being compared have similar variance
3. data are independent

For a parametrical statistical tests, it assumes sample comes from normal distribution but according to central limit theorem if sample size is large the requirement of sample to be normally distributed is not neccessary (as the sample size increases sample mean approaches to population mean). So PARAMETRICAL TEST can be used if you have large samples without need to meed of being normally distributed but other 2 assumption should be met. Any sample size > 30 is considered large sample.

Standard normal distribution is called z-distribution. Special normal distribution where mean = 0 and std deviation = 1. Any normal distribution can be converted into standard normal distribution by converting its value into z-scores. z-score tells about a data point is how many std deviation away from mean. If z-score is +ve, a particular data point is above the mean and below if it is -ve.  z-score = 1, means the data point is 1 std deviation above from the mean and z-score = -2 means the data point is 2 std deviation below from the mean.
z = x - populationmean/ std deviation.
WHILE DOING Z-TEST, z-score is the test statistic used in a z-test. z-test is used to compare the means of two groups or to compare the mean of a group to a known value.
