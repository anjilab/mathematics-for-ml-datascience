Probability helps in interpreting the outputs of ML algorithms.

Probability:
how likely event will occur.
experiment: is the one that produces outcome which is uncertain.
P(event) = total outcomes of event/ sample space

Probability of exactly getting 2 5's = 1/36 = (6*6 = sample space, outcomes (5,5) = 1)

Complement of event P(C')= 1- P(C)

Sum of probabilities in case of disjoint events(Mutually exclusive):
If you know the probability of event 1 and event 2, now you want to know the probability of event occuring 1 or 2, then you simply add two events. But to add you need to make sure they are disjoint. Meaning they are mutually exclusive: i.e when event 1 occurs there is no chance event 2 will occur & viceversa.

Probability of obtaining even number or 5: here when event of even number occurence takes place, you will never see 5 taking place. Hence, disjoint set or mutually exclusive events. so prob of 5 = 1/6 and prob of even number = no of even number in dice/sample space = count of {2,4,6} / 6 = 3/6 = 1/2
so prob of even number or 5 = 1/6 + 1/2 = 4/6

Sum of probabilities in case of joint events.(Non-mutually exclusive):

For eg: Prob of rain = 80% and Prob of windy = 70% so prob of rain or windy = 80 + 70 = 150% which is not correct, as well as probability lies between 0 and 1. Here when there is chance of rain, we also see wind, meaning there is prob of rain and wind too. in real life too, there are no such disjoint events rather we will find more joint events.

Prob sum = 7 or diff = 1 while rolling two dice, 
Prob sum = 7 will be ={(1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1)}/36 =  6/36 
Prob diff = 1 will be ={(1,2),(2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,3), (4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,5)}/36 = 10/36
Prob that sum =7 and diff = 1 = {(3,4),(4,3)}/36 = 2/36 [here, two outcomes (3,4),(4,3) occurs in both events]
so, Prob(Sum = 7 or diff =1) = 6/36 + 10/36 - 2/36 


INDEPENDENCE:

When occurrence of one event doesnot affect the outcome of another event. In case of coin toss, whatever the outcome is in first toss is not depended upon second toss. But in case of chess, your tenth move is dependent upon 2nd move. 

There are 50(0.5) students who play soccerr and 50(0.5) don't. We split randomly students, in one room how many students who will play soccer. i.e 25 each of who play soccer and who don't. ) = 0.5*50 = 25

Similary, there are 40 students who play soccer  & 60 students who don't. We split randomly in two rooms where one room has 30 and another has 70 students. what is the number of students in room with 30 students play soccer. =0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12 = 12 students will play soccer.

P(A âˆ© B) = P(A)*P(B) [in case of independence]

For a coins in which outcomes are independent, assume you toss coin 5 times, the probability of landing head 5 times is given by P(HHHHH) 
We know that Probability of heads in each outcome  = P(H) = 1/sample space = 1 / 2
So, P(HHHHH) = P(H)*P(H)*P(H)*P(H)*P(H) = 0.5*0.5*0.5*0.5*0.5 = 0.5^5 = 0.03125

In case of rolling dice too: Probability of 6 in two dice = P(6 in first dice) * P(6 in second dice) = 1/6*1/6 = 1/36

BIRTHDAY PROBLEM: 
You meet 30 random people. What is the probability that 2 of you have birthday on same day ?

1. Probability that 2 people will have birthday on same day ? or
2. Probability that none of you will have birthday on same day ?


Consider 1 person, his birthday might be any day in 365 days so Prob = outcomes/sample-space = possible values for his birthday/total days = 365/365 
Consider another person, his birthday is not the same day of another person, so his possible outcomes will be 364 as 1 day is already reserved for upper person and it has mentioned that there is no chance they have birthday on same day so Prob of second person birthday = 364/365. similarly adding another person whose birthday wont be on same day then Prob = 363/365. So if these 3 people in the room, prob that their birthday are on different birthday = 365/365*364/365*363/365 = 365*364*363 / (365)^3


Here if we plot the graph of Probability they won't have same birthday.
