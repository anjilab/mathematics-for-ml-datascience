# Chapter 1 Week 1:

## Introduction to NumPy
NumPy is main package for python for any kind of scientific computing.(Numerical python)

### NumPy arrays
Array = core data structure in any programming language for organizing data of same type. In core python, we use lists. List takes up more space in the memory & time to process(Research why more space & time) and have limite functions. Hence we use NumPy array.

Due to its extensive built in function,computing takes very less amount of time so performing on large sets of data is convenient.

Array object in NumPy is ndarray meaning n-dimensional array.
